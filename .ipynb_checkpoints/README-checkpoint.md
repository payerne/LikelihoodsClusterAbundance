This repository for studying cluster abundance likelihoods

- The directory `\modules\...` containes the python modules for studying cluster abundance likeloods.

- The directory `\notebooks\Testing_likelihood_accuracy_with_PINOCCHIO\` contains the binned cluster abundance likelihood analysis that is presented in [Payerne et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.6223P/abstract). `\modules\pinocchio_analysis_testing_accuracy\` contains the job files. You can find a presentaion of this work 'Testing the likelihood accuracy for cluster abundance cosmology' at the [GDR on Cosmology](https://indico.ijclab.in2p3.fr/event/8881/contributions/28596/). 

- The directory `\modules\Unbinned_likelihood_with_SSC\` is dedicated to include Super-Sample Covariance in the unbinned likelihood for cluster count cosmology. This analysis is detailles in [Payerne et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240110024P/abstract) and was also presented at the [Journ√©es Rubin LSST France](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/30995/contributions/131829/).
